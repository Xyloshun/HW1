Reading Summary:
  The two readings that were provided for us were the Roadmap for a Frontend
  Developer, and A Guide to Becoming a Full Stack Developer. For the roadmap,
  it provided a neat path to what to tackle in learning how to be a frontend
  web developer. Fortunately enough, I've stumbled upon many buzz words early on
  that I have a vague memory of using. Upon reading the guide, I figured how that
  reading really reinforced my understanding of each of the languages used to
  develop a website along with the anatomy analogy. A specific takeaway I got was
  the importance of GitHub and how to make repositories to show and store my
  working in progress projects and websites. I also started to realize that even
  though the roadmap was quite neat to follow, it was still a lot of information
  and steps to take in. A lot of it was review of the basics of CSS, HTML, and
  JavaScript however, but things like Version Control Systems and Web Security
  are all new concepts to me. In short, a lot of what I've seen or have a miniscule
  understanding of are now presented to me in an easy to follow roadmap and guide
  that would get me through the course of GUI Programming I.
